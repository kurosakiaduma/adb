# Address Book
This project is an address book webpage that helps leaners to get more on the concepts of object oriented programming; how to create objects and modify the properties within them as well as their constructors.

The webpage allows users input contact info and displays each name in a list, and when clicked on displays each contacts full name.

### Prequisites
1. You **need a Github account** to clone the project directory from my repository.

1. The webpage needs to be run on **Google Chrome** browser. It's okay to use any other web browser but I reccommend Chrome because of it's extensive extensions that allow some of the extra features I threw into the page to function well.

1. To view the raw code of the webpage you will probably need a text editor e..g **Atom** or **Brackets**

1. You will also need to obtain Bootstrap file css from [getbootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

1. I have added an extra bootstrap file on fonts within the repo that enables me to use pre-edited icons. These can be obtained from [Fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/)


### Installing
* Using your **Terminal**, you will need to clone/fork the repository containing the root folder to your computer using this command: $ git clone https://github.com/kurosakiaduma/adb

OR

* Directly download the root folder to your computer using [this link](https://github.com/kurosakiaduma/adb/archive/master.zip)

## Deployment
1. After unpacking the contents, use **Atom** to open the **HTML** **CSS**and **Bootstrap** to view the source code of the project.

1. Run the project in Google Chrome **(reccommended)** or any other web browser to view it in deployed version.

1. Scorll through the webpage and **"listen"** out for something that I added to the background. Hopefully you'll figure that out.

1. Test the project live by editting its source code using **Google Developer Tools**.
